# foundation-dynamic-tables

Designed to enable **easier reading of tables on mobile devices**, this simple bit of code displays a table which, under a particular screen size, displays the information vertically rather than horizontally and places the header text next to each item.

The styling system utilises the [Zurb Foundation Sites](http://foundation.zurb.com) styling framework.

There are a couple of additional styles at the top of the code to demonstrate the ability to customise the information based on whether it is a horizontal or vertical table.

This code has repeating header `<span>` statements for each table cell, so that **it will work without the use of Javascript**. However you can vastly reduce the amount of code and the maintainability of your code by adding some Javascript code to add in this code automatically.
